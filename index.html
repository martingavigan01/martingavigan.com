            <p>At the beginning of 2019, I decided it was time to teach myself how to code. 
                    <br> I asked some friends and was guided towards starting with HTML and maybe creating a website. 
                    To make my first attempt useful I decided to create a blog.
        <br>
        I plan to build out this site, applying what I have learnt as I go and also posting progress. 
        <br>  
        As I will be releasing as I go, some areas of the site may not work straight away. 
        <br>
        Please bare with me, its most likely because I havent learnt 'how to' yet for that functionality.    
        <br>  
        HAPPY READING!!!!

    <h3><b>My First HTML Page     <span class="w3-opacity">January 8, 2018</span></h3>
  </div>

  <div class="w3-container">
    <p>It all first started by deciding to learn something new. 
      When I looked at what to learn, HTML, CCS and Javascript appeared to be good starting points.

      After searching on the web, I found the W3 School site, (the link is on the left) which has been helpful and simple to understand. 
  
      This helped me to create my first HTML page, which was fairly simple. 
      All you need is a text editor to write the HTML and a browser display the page.

<div class="w3-card-4 w3-margin w3-white">

        <h3><b>Creating a My Web Domain </b> <span class="w3-opacity">January 9, 2018</span></h3>
      </div>
  
      <div class="w3-container">
        <p>Overnight, I decided that a good challenge would be to build a website. 
          <br>
          Step 1 in doing this was to registering my domain. I was creative and decided to register "martingavigan.com". 
          <br>
          To do this, I asked a friend and he suggested 'GoDaddy' to register the domain but not to use them 
          to host as you can do that yourself in AWS, and its cheaper.
<br>
          To registry a domain was simple and is created in 15 mins.

          Once you have the domain, GoDaddy place a default page on the site. 
          The next step was to replace that page with an intial site I created.

        <h3><b>Hosting My Site </b> <span class="w3-opacity">January 9, 2018</span></h3>
      </div>
  
      <div class="w3-container">
        <p>Now I have a domain, I now need a place to host my site and content.
          <br>
          For this, Im using Amazon Web Services, the link is on the right.
          I found this <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/website-hosting-custom-domain-walkthrough.html">page</a> very useful. 
          The page walks you through the steps needed to config "S3", which is a cloud storage space that will hold your sites content and Route 53, 
          which connects your new domain name to the place where your content is stored. This means, once people enter your domain URL into a browner, they will sent to your content stored
          in S3. 

          The one thing the link does tell you. Once you have completed the steps, you will need to copy the nameservers that are defined by Route 53
          and save them against your domain name in GoDaddy. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7kqlkvllv0">YouTube tutorial</a> explain how to do this,
           (it also includes the step on the link)
