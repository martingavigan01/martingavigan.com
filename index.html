      <h3><b>Learning Web Development</b></h3>
    </div>
    <div class="w3-container">
            <p>At the beginning of 2019, I decided it was time to teach myself how to code. 
              <br>
               I asked some friends and was guided towards starting with HTML and maybe creating a website. 
               To make my first attempt useful I decided to create a blog. 
              <br>
               I plan to build out this site, applying what I have learnt as I go and also posting progress. 
              <br>
               As I will be releasing as I go, some areas of the site may not work straight away. 
              <br>
               Please bare with me, its most likely because I haven't learnt 'how to' yet for that functionality.  
               <br>
               HAPPY READING!!!!

      <h3><b>My First HTML Page     <span class="w3-opacity">January 8, 2018</span></h3>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>It started by deciding to learn something new. 
        <br>
        When I looked at what to learn, HTML, CCS and Javascript appeared to be good starting points. 
        After searching Online, I found the W3 School site, (the link is on the right) which has been helpful and simple to understand. 
        This helped me to create my first HTML page, which was fairly simple. 
        All you need is a text editor to write the HTML and a browser display the page.

<!-- Second  Blog entry -->
    <div class="w3-card-4 w3-margin w3-white">
      <img src="domain_Name.png" alt="domain_name" style="widows:50%">
        <div class="w3-container">
          <h3><b>Creating My Web Domain </b> <span class="w3-opacity">January 9, 2018</span></h3>
        </div>
    
        <div class="w3-container">
          <p>Overnight, I decided that a good challenge would be to build a website. 
            <br>
            The first step was to create and register a domain. I was creative and decided to register "martingavigan.com". 
            <br>
            To register the domain a friend suggested using 'GoDaddy'. 
            He said to use them only to register the domain 
            but not to host, as you can do cheaply yourself in AWS.
  <br>
            Registering the domain was simple and the site was created in 15 mins.
            <br>
            Once I had the domain, GoDaddy placed a default page on the site. 
            The next step was to replace that page with an intial site I created.
            </p>
        </div>

<!-- Third Blog entry -->
<div class="w3-card-4 w3-margin w3-white">
    <img src="web_hosting.jpeg" alt="web_hosting" style="widows:50%">
      <div class="w3-container">
        <h3><b>Hosting My Site </b> <span class="w3-opacity">January 9, 2018</span></h3>
      </div>
  
      <div class="w3-container">
        <p>
            Now I have a domain, I need a place to host my site and content. 
            For this, I'm using Amazon Web Services, (the link is on the right). 
            <br>
            To help with the setup, I found this <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/website-hosting-custom-domain-walkthrough.html" target="_blank">page</a> very useful. 
          √\The page walks you through the steps needed to configure S3, which is the cloud storage that will hold your content, and Route 53, which connects your new domain name to the place where your content is stored. This means, once people enter your domain URL into a browser, they will be sent to your content stored in S3. 
          <br>
          The one thing the link does tell you is that once you have completed the steps, you will need to copy the nameservers that are defined by Route 53 and save them against your domain name in GoDaddy. 
          This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7kqlkvllv0" target="_blank">YouTube tutorial</a> explains how to do this,
           (it also includes the steps covered in the AWS link).
          <br>
          One final point, you can test the set up as you go to ensure the right permissions and configuration have been added in S3 and Route 53. 
          Also, routing from your domain to the nameservers defined in AWS can take some time to happen. 
          <br> Be Patient!
